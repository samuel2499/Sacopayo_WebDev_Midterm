<p><center>
Bouncing through many teams the Finnish player joined the Dota 2 pro scene in 2013. After on and off time participating actively in the scene, he's found the most success on the team OG. A position 4 player, his roaming support style makes him the playmaker for whatever team he is on, making space and setting up ganks whenever needed. He is most famous for his signature hero Earth Spirit, for who he spent hours practicing upon the hero's release. Noted as one, if not the best Earth Spirit player, he defined the hero in the pro scene, playing an impressive over 500 matches, and earning himself a 75 percent win rate. Winner of four majors he continued to thrive on OG. He retired after winning TI two times consecutively.

He currently has his own website, Jerax.gg, where he has a Q&A page and a webstore for his supporters.
